# VFS

Go module that acts as an in-memory database engine to manipulate a file tree.

## Skills Demonstrated

### Algorithmic Capabilities

This module is structured as a tree of nodes, requiring algorithmic skills. While the logic isn't highly complex, it demonstrates my ability to create readable and efficient algorithms.

### Clean Code

* **Separation of Concerns**: Each subpackage is independent. The module only exposes an interface to the client and the `Node` object.
* **Meaningful Naming**: The code is simple and readable, with descriptive names that enhance clarity.

### Unit Testing

All code is tested using the `unit test factory` pattern. While 100% coverage isn't possible for certain edge cases, the module is thoroughly tested.
